	Personal
</h2>

<p>
	I am a high school student in Turkey getting an education as an IB student, and I am a person who loves to code. I created dozens of projects with C, C++, Python, and JavaScript. I competed and still compete in olympiads in informatics, for which I was on the national team for two years.

	Hobbies
</h2>

<p>
	I love to listen to music, but it may not be your ordinary music playlist. I mostly listen to electronic and classical music, in addition to game soundtracks. Composers/artists I listen to: Lena Raine, Sibelius, Mendelsshon, C418, Cristopher Larkin, Chris Christodoulou, Ben Prunty, Aphex Twin, Olivier Deriviere, Noah Giesler, Neal Acree, Squarepusher.

	Another thing I do in my free time is to solve the Rubik's Cube. I average around 10-11 seconds on the normal 3x3. I also solve Square-1 and 2x2, but my averages on them are not as good as it is on the 3x3.

	When I'm out and there is nothing to do, I play Chess on my phone. For now, I'm not that invested in Chess, but I want to be. Chess is such a fascinating game and I really want to play it on the next level. At least for now, I am 1050 elo on <a href="https://">Chess.com</a>.

	I also have a blog where I post random stuff to. You can access it through this <a href="https://blog.mkutay.dev">link</a>.
